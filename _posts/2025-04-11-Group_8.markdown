## Authors
 - Ansh Kapoor

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in our experiments is **DeepCrack**:

- **Size:** 537 RGB images (384×544 px)  
- **Split:** 300 training, 237 testing  
- **Imbalance:** ~3.5% crack pixels, max ~20% in some images  
- **Application:** Pavement/road crack detection and segmentation

## 🧠 Model(s)
We implemented and compared the following models:

- **CNN Baselines:** ResNet50-UNet, VGG19-UNet  
- **Transformers:** SegFormer (B0), Swin Transformer (Small), Mask2Former (Swin-Small), UNetFormer (modified)  

Each model was fine-tuned for binary crack segmentation. Loss function: Weighted BCE + Dice.  

## 📈 Results
Average performance metrics on the **DeepCrack test set**:

| Model            | IoU   | Dice  | Precision | Recall | Accuracy |
|------------------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| ResNet50-UNet    | 0.513 | 0.624 | 0.557     | 0.750  | 0.968    |
| VGG19-UNet       | 0.465 | 0.587 | 0.506     | 0.749  | 0.961    |
| SegFormer (B0)   | 0.596 | 0.682 | 0.694     | 0.698  | 0.976    |
| Swin Transformer | 0.554 | 0.653 | 0.610     | 0.740  | 0.970    |
| Mask2Former      | 0.520 | 0.625 | 0.550     | 0.773  | 0.965    |
| UNetFormer       | **0.667** | **0.789** | 0.717     | **0.922** | **0.982** |

## 📌 Notes

- Transformer-based models consistently outperformed CNN baselines.  
- UNetFormer achieved the best overall results (highest IoU, Dice, Recall).  
- SegFormer delivered the cleanest predictions (best Precision).  
- Weighted BCE + Dice ensured high recall (fewer missed cracks), but slightly increased false positives.  
- Some of the zip files containing prediction were not pushed due to github size constraints
