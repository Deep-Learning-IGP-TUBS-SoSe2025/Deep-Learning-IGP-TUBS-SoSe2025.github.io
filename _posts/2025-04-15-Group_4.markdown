## Dataset
The dataset used in our experiments is [KolektorSDD2](https://www.vicos.si/resources/kolektorsdd2/).  
- Contains high-resolution surface defect images from industrial settings.  
- Includes **defective** (positive) and **non-defective** (negative) samples.  
- Images were cropped into **256×256 patches**.  
- Data imbalance tackled via **positive-centered sampling and augmentation**.  

## Model(s)
We employed a **model zoo of segmentation architectures**:  
- FCN-ResNet50  
- U-Net (ResNet50 backbone)  
- DeepLabV3-ResNet50  
- SegFormer-B0  

Each model was trained with **Dice + BCE combo loss**, dynamic positive weighting, and discriminative learning rates.  

## Results
Quantitative results. All models were trained with dynamic positive weighting. The best results per column are highlighted in **bold**.

Qualitative results. From left to right: input, ground truth, and predictions and overlays from FCN-R50, U-Net-R50, DeepLabV3-R50, SegFormer-B0, with and without data augmentation. Overlay masks: True Positives (yellow), False Positives (red), and False Negatives (green).

Summary:  
- **Best IoU & Dice** → FCN-ResNet50  
- **Best Recall** → DeepLabV3-R50  
- **Best Precision** → SegFormer-B0  
- **U-Net** underperformed compared to other models.
